xmasvm - Simple virtual machine written in Rust.

This is a holiday project to help teach me about Rust and to better appreciate
the lower levels of a machine.

The goals are to:

  1. Make an instruction set
  1. Make an interpreter for instruction set
  1. Make a compiler for instruction set
  1. Learn Rust

Possible stretch goals

  1. Make binary form (encoding) as universal bytecode format
  1. Make simple assembler
